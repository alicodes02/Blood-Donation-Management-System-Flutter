# Blood Donation Management System

## Getting Started

This is the Front End UI Design which i recently made using "Flutter" for a semester Project.

The name of the Project is "Blood Donation Management System". This App has following screens:

. Sign In
. Sign Up
. Request Blood
. Donate Blood

Firstly, the screens were designed on "Figma" and then replicated in Flutter. Several design principles were kept in mind during the development.

I selected the Red theme because of the context of the system, different types of buttons, texfields, navigations and pop ups are used in the development.

It's my first Front End project on Flutter Framework.

Looking forward to integrate back end with it for authenticating and registering users.
